# Deliverable 2 - **Transactional Service Methods**

This deliverable requires that you create working solution(s) for your query and transactional service methods using Linqpad. Test the service method(s). **All** method are to be coded in a single Linqpad Program environment file. Once you have a working query or transactional method, implementation the method in your class library subsystem.

> ***NOTE:*** Compiler errors that prevent the project from loading may be treated as an automatic mark of zero for this section.

Be sure to develop your solution in small increments, making frequent commits and referencing your issue numbers from GitHub.

Your Linqpad solution should:

### Query method

1. a query displaying the data 
1. use either the data models provide or your own
1. use the Main method as the driver for testing
1. place the service in it's own appropriate method
   
### Transaction method

1. contain user friendly error handling 
1. a query(ies) displaying the data manipulated by the service method transaction
1. use of the data models provide or your own
1. use the Main method as the driver for testing
1. place the service in it's own appropriate method

**Use your class demonstrations in accomplishing this task.** You may discover issues with your original Planning document. **DO NOT** alter your original comments of your plan. Create **new** comments within your Planning document issue to track any changes to your original plan.
