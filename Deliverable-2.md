***DO NOT start this section until you have the group work completed as you will be working in your own class libraries and within your own web page folder.***


***Remember to complete the security implementation for your team project before your final submission. Implement security with sufficient time to test.***

## Scenario Implementation

Complete the implementation of your scenario/subsystem. 

> ***NOTE:*** Compiler errors that prevent the project from loading may be treated as an automatic mark of zero for this section.
