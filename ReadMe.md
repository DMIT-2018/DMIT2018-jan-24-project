Imagine a system where the latest cycling gear, parts, and accessories are just a click away. The **Purchasing subsystem** will revolutionize how Bikes R Us® Inc. stocks its shelves, ensuring that the store not only keeps up with the latest trends but also anticipates the needs of its customers. This system will empower the company to:

### [Receiving](Receiving/ReadMe.md)

As new products arrive, the **Receiving subsystem** will serve as the welcoming committee. This isn't just about checking boxes and counting items; it's about ensuring that every product meets the high standards of Bikes R Us® Inc. before it makes its way to the sales floor. This process guarantees that customers only get the best, maintaining the trust and quality Bikes R Us® Inc. is known for.

### [Servicing](Servicing/ReadMe.md) 

The heart of Bikes R Us® Inc. beats strongest in the **Servicing area**. This subsystem will create a seamless bridge between customers needing maintenance or repair services and the skilled technicians ready to bring their bikes back to peak performance. It's about more than fixing problems; it's about fostering a community where every cyclist knows they're supported, whether they're prepping for a race or just keeping their ride smooth.

### [Sales & Returns](SalesReturns/ReadMe.md)

Finally, the **Sales subsystem** is where all the magic happens. It's where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. This isn't just about transactions; it's about creating an experience that customers will remember. From the moment they walk in, to the moment they ride out on their new bike, the Sales subsystem will ensure that every interaction is smooth, enjoyable, and tailored to each customer's needs.

## The Pitch

In a world where technology and passion intersect, Bikes R Us® Inc. stands at the forefront, ready to redefine what a bike shop can be. This isn't just about selling bikes; it's about building a community and fueling a passion. With these four subsystems, Bikes R Us® Inc. will not only streamline its operations but also enhance the customer experience, setting a new benchmark in the cycling retail industry.

So, we invite you to join us on this journey. Together, we can turn the gears of progress and ride into a future where every cycle, from purchase to pedal, is a testament to the spirit of cycling. Welcome to Bikes R Us® Inc. – where technology meets passion, and the road ahead is full of possibilities.

## Overview
